Implementation of various FFT algorithms (mainly in C/C++), along with their analysis and some benchmarking. Also a bit of optimization attempts here and there.

## To Do:
1. Discrete Fourier Transform (the simplest O(n^2) implementation, not FFT)
2. Cooley-Tukey algorithm
3. Prime-factor FFT algorithm
4. Bruun's FFT algorithm
5. Rader's FFT algorithm
6. Bluestein's FFT algorithm
7. Winograd's FFT algorithm
8. Hexagonal FFT algorithm
9. Fast Hartley Transform algorithm
10. Quick Fourier Transform algorithm
